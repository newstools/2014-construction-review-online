The Board of Directors from the African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a USD 74.7m loan to finance the upgrading of Rwanda’s transport system which is to be implemented between 2015 and 2019. The project is the first phase of Rwanda’s Transport Sector Project which involves rehabilitation of the Base-Rukomo road along the Base-Gicumbi_Rukomo-Nyagatare axis. The project has four major components which includes upgrading of 51.54 Km between Base and Rukomo, the construction of multifunctional centers for women and rehabilitation of school facilities along the main road, institutional support to the project executing agency and finally, clearing the right-of-way. The entire construction project will cost US$78.99m and counterpart funding from the Rwandan Government of US$4.52m. The main adjective of the project is to contribute to the socio-economic development of the country, improve regional integration and standards of living through an improved and integrated transport system. It will also generate sustained employment in rural areas through road maintenance works. Rwanda is the process of revamping its transport sector throughout the country. The City of Kigali is presently putting in place infrastructure to support public transport. Over 24 Km of roads are also being paved to connect some suburbs of the city while reducing congestion on some of the trunk roads. Included in the infrastructure expansion projects, is a second airport, Bugesera International Airport, which is supposed to be ready by 2017. This new airport will be the largest in the country once complete.

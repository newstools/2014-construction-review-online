Rwanda is planning to construct a new petroleum storage facility that will have capacity to store 21 million liters – a move that will help boost the overall national reserve that currently stands at 30 million litres. The new facility will also aid in the country’s transportation and importation sectors in the industry. It will be located in Gasabo District, Kigali, and it is anticipated to be complete in the next four months. The petroleum storage facility project is being constructed by Societe Petroliere Ltd (SP), a local company dealing in transportation and distribution of petroleum products. Jean Paul Rubulika, the operations manager for Societe Petroliere Ltd has said the upcoming project will help Rwanda greatly since the country consumes about 25-30 million litres of petroleum a month – it means that in case of an emergency, the reserves would last for only a week. The government is also seeking to boost the country’s capacity for more fuel stock – up to 150 million litres of petroleum – by partnering with private oil dealers. Currently, the largest storage facility is Gatsata Depots – it has a capacity of 15 million litres. Kabuye, on the other hand, holds 5 million litres of petroleum. Both petroleum storage facilities are supplemented by smaller facilities located at Kigali International Airport and Rwabuye. In terms of energy, Rwanda was planning to set up a US$12m hydro power plant in in Nyabihu, Western Province.

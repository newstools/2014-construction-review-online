The Kigali Convention Center is due for completion after experiencing financial setbacks for the four years that the project has been running. The Rwanda Minister for Finance and Economic Planning, Ambassador Claver Gatete has said the Convention Centre will be commissioned this year. The oval dome will have more than 292 rooms, a conference centre that can host 2,500 people, office and commercial spaces. The convention centre, which is Rwandaâ€™s first, is standing between the city centre and the airport in proximity to key government offices including the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court and Parliament. The Rwf128 bn (US$188m) project seeks to improve the country`s hospitality sector, attract and host international conferences and enhance the country`s foreign exchange reserves. The Finance Minister has stated that the facility will be managed by Radisson Blu, which is an international hotelier with more than 420 hotel chains in more than 73 countries once completed. The project is being developed by a Chinese firm, Beijing Construction Engineering Group. The Rwandese government last year issued a US$400m Eurobond mainly to get funds to complete the project. This comes at a time when Africa`s hospitality industry is undergoing major changes and renovations due the new found interest by internationally renowned hotel operators.

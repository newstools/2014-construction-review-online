KAIG plans to be the largest temperature-controlled garden in the world and will incorporate techniques in power generation and water conservation designed to ensure minimal environmental impact. the park’s power requirements will be supplemented by on-site renewable technologies such as solar, wind and combined heat and power sources. Water conservation will be maximised in aid from massive underground reservoirs,  allowing storage with minimal evaporation, as grey water will be recycled throughout the site.

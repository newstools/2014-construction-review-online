The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is planning a multi-dollar ultra-modern shopping mall in the heart of Garki District in Nigeria. The new facility will be located in front of the Garki Model Market in Abuja. The planned structure is a six-floor covering 7000 total floor area and the design targets a fully air-conditioned shopping environment. Also planned for construction is a multi-level/basement parking facility, among many modern facilities such as a state of the art security and surveillance system. The multi-dollar ultra-modern shopping mall will also have retail shops, eateries, banking halls and elevators/escalators. Messrs Lubell Nigeria Limited is the project contractor and is expected to deliver on the project in 85 weeks. The ground-breaking ceremony would be performed by Minister of the FCT, Senator Bala Mohammed. Managing Director of AMML, a subsidiary of Abuja Investments Company Limited, Alhaji Abubakar Usman Faruk, has said that the ultra-modern shopping mall project by FCTA was in line with President Goodluck Jonathanâ€™s transformation agenda. The new modern mall will act as a shopping hub for the residents and visitors of the FCC.

The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) has entered into agreement with the Tunisia government that will see the fund provide US$160m for the construction of various roads and related facilities in the country. The partnership was signed by Tunisiaâ€™s Minister for Development and International Cooperation Mr. Mohamed Nouri Jouini. According to the Kuwait Fund President, Abdellatif El Hamad, the fund will also ensure establishment of a new dam at the Qafsa district, North of Tunisia. The fund will also aid in construction projects in energy, electricity, higher education and other sectors. AFESD is a key financial partner of the Tunisia government. In total, it has helped in the construction of projects in transport, energy, farming, water and highways sectors, all reaching a total worth of two billion Tunisian dinars. The deal, however, is a loan to be repaid in 22-year period and Tunisia will have only five years of grace period.

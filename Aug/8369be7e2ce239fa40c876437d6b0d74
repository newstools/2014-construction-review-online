The Government of Rwanda is going to receive up to US$610m to support various projects as stipulated in the 2014-2020 budget. This was revealed during a Cooperation Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) meeting held in Kigali, Rwanda by Achim Tillessen the head of EUâ€™s delegation in Rwanda. During this meeting government officials and donors reviewed the progress made in the implementation of the 10th European Development Funding (EDF) for Rwanda. The funds were meant to run from 2008-2013 with the donor giving US$573m to the Rwandan Government. Key sectors that benefited the most from this program are: rural development, infrastructure for regional interconnectivity, regional integration and support to non-state actors. Among the projects is the rehabilitation Kigali-Gatuna road project which started in January 2012 and is expected to be complete by 2016. The project received 57 million Euros. Achim Tillessen indicated that they are impressed at the rate at which the Rwandan government is implementing the various projects being funded by the donor and that is why they have increased the amount for the 11th EDF funds for the 2014-2020 periods. The director of external finance at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Ronald Nkusi said that the money will finance critical sectors that directly feed into the second Economic Development and Poverty Eradication Strategy (EDPRS II) goals and will be channeled through budgetary support for specific sectors.

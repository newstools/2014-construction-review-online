The Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) has confirmed that plans to construct a ring road to circumnavigate Kampala are in advanced stage. The Kampala Outer Beltway is aimed at reducing traffic jams on the main roads entering the city centre. UNRA publicist, Dan Alinange, said the main thing UNRA is looking at is to distribute traffic especially on Jinja road and Entebbe road when entering the city adding that the objective of the project is to ensure that commuters from Jinja to Gaba can connect straight to their destination without coming to the city centre. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};Last week, UNRA announced tenders for a feasibility study and the design plan for the 100km road.UNRA said that the road will start around Gaba, running through Mukono/ Seeta, Namugongo, Kira, Kasangati, Matugga, Wakiso, Buloba and Nsangi, linking with the proposed Kampala-Jinja, Kampala-Entebbe and Kampala-Mpigi express ways. According to UNRA, a consultancy firm, which will carry out a feasibility study of upgrading the selected route to an express highway, including consideration of alternative routes and pavement design options will be contracted by September. The firm will also look at the environmental and social impact study, road safety assessments, land acquisition, economic and financial analysis. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The urban congestion is increasing in Kampala at an estimated rate of 4.5% annually with increased motorization thus Kampala is facing heavy traffic jams, especially during the peak hours and the road can no longer accommodate current traffic. The Kampala-Entebbe Expressway is also part of the measures to decongest the Central Business District and enhance trade movement through, within and out of the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area. The mandate of UNRA is to develop and maintain the national roads network, advise Government on general roads policy and contribute to addressing of transport concerns, among others.
